# Area Calculator

This repository contains an example code for calculating the area of different shapes using object-oriented programming in Python. The project includes three shape classes: `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`. Google style docstrings are used for comments, and Sphinx is used for generating the documentation.

Main objective of this repository is to provide an example of document generation using Sphinx.
